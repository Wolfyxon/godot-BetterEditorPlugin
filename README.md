# BetterEditorPlugin
A upgraded API for Godot editor plugins made in pure GDScript.  
Supports Godot version 4.0 and above.
### Disclaimer
This class might stop working properly in a Godot update changes the node structure of the editor since it uses methods that are not in the official API by manually finding and modifying nodes. This class is also currently work-in-progress.
